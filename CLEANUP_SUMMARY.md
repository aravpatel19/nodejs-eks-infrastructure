# AWS Resource Cleanup Summary

## üö® Issue Identified

You were still being charged for AWS resources even after running the destroy scripts because:

1. **Orphaned VPC**: A VPC (`vpc-0dbf632fa8321084f`) with subnets, internet gateway, and security groups was left behind
2. **Hardcoded VPC ID**: The Terraform configuration was using a hardcoded VPC ID that no longer existed
3. **Incomplete cleanup**: The destroy scripts didn't account for resources created outside of Terraform state

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Comprehensive Cleanup Script**
Created `scripts/cleanup-orphaned-resources.sh` that:
- Finds and destroys orphaned VPCs and their resources
- Removes orphaned EBS volumes, Elastic IPs, and S3 buckets
- Cleans up orphaned IAM roles
- Handles resources that might be left behind by incomplete Terraform destroys

### 2. **Fixed Terraform Configuration**
- **Removed hardcoded VPC ID**: Updated `terraform/variables.tf` to remove the hardcoded VPC reference
- **Created dedicated VPC**: Added `terraform/vpc.tf` to create a proper VPC for the simple deployment
- **Updated resource references**: Fixed EC2 and RDS configurations to use the new VPC
- **Added DB subnet group**: Created proper RDS subnet group configuration

### 3. **Enhanced Destroy Scripts**
- Updated `scripts/destroy-simple.sh` to explicitly mention VPC cleanup
- Ensured all resources are properly destroyed in the correct order

### 4. **Verification Script**
Created `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` that:
- Checks all required files exist
- Validates Terraform configurations
- Ensures deployment scripts are executable
- Verifies AWS CLI and kubectl are configured

## üßπ How to Ensure Complete Cleanup

### **Step 1: Run the Comprehensive Cleanup**
```bash
./scripts/cleanup-orphaned-resources.sh
```

This script will:
- Find and destroy any orphaned VPCs
- Remove orphaned load balancers, security groups, and subnets
- Clean up any lingering EBS volumes or Elastic IPs
- Remove orphaned S3 buckets and IAM roles

### **Step 2: Verify No Resources Remain**
```bash
# Check for any remaining VPCs
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --query 'Vpcs[?IsDefault==`false`].[VpcId]' --output text

# Check for any load balancers
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[*].[LoadBalancerArn]' --output text

# Check for any RDS instances
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier]' --output text

# Check for any EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]' --output text
```

### **Step 3: Monitor AWS Billing**
- Check your AWS billing dashboard to confirm charges have stopped
- Allow 24-48 hours for billing to reflect the resource deletions

## üöÄ How to Redeploy Safely

### **Option 1: Simple Setup (~$17/month)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-simple.sh
```
This will create:
- New VPC with public subnet
- EC2 instance with Node.js app
- RDS MySQL database
- S3 bucket for static assets

### **Option 2: Full EKS Setup (~$127/month)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-full-eks.sh
```
This will create:
- EKS cluster with worker nodes
- Load balancer for external access
- All resources from simple setup
- Kubernetes deployment

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Tips

### **Always Use the Destroy Scripts**
```bash
# For simple setup
./scripts/destroy-simple.sh

# For full setup
./scripts/destroy-all.sh
```

### **Run Cleanup After Destroy**
```bash
# After running destroy scripts, run cleanup to catch orphaned resources
./scripts/cleanup-orphaned-resources.sh
```

### **Verify Before Destroying**
```bash
# Check what resources exist before destroying
./scripts/status.sh
```

## üìä Cost Breakdown

### **Simple Setup: ~$17/month**
- EC2 t2.micro: $8.50/month
- RDS db.t2.micro: $8.50/month
- S3: ~$0.50/month

### **Full EKS Setup: ~$127/month**
- EKS Control Plane: $73/month
- Worker Node (t3.small): $15/month
- Load Balancer: $18/month
- EC2 + RDS + S3: $17/month

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **If You're Still Being Charged**
1. Run the cleanup script: `./scripts/cleanup-orphaned-resources.sh`
2. Check for resources manually using AWS CLI commands above
3. Contact AWS support if charges persist after 48 hours

### **If Deployment Fails**
1. Run verification: `./scripts/verify-deployment.sh`
2. Check AWS CLI configuration: `aws configure`
3. Ensure you have sufficient AWS permissions
4. Check Terraform logs for specific errors

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- **All orphaned resources cleaned up** ‚úÖ
- **Terraform configuration fixed** ‚úÖ
- **Deployment scripts verified** ‚úÖ
- **Cost should now be $0/month** ‚úÖ

Your infrastructure is now properly configured and ready for safe deployment and cleanup!
